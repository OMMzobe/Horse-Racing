1. Project Overview
1.1 Introduction
Horse racing is a competitive sport where horses, guided by jockeys, race to finish first. This project focuses on analyzing horse race data from the year 2020, using the races_2020.csv dataset, which contains information about race distances, track conditions, prizes, and winning times. By conducting an in-depth analysis of these factors, the project seeks to provide data-driven insights into what makes certain horses successful.

1.1.1 Problem Statement
Predicting race outcomes is a complex task due to the numerous factors that affect horse performance, such as race distance, track conditions, and horse attributes. This project aims to apply a more structured and data-driven approach to uncovering the factors that most influence race results, helping trainers and enthusiasts optimize race strategies.

1.1.2 Aim
The main aim is to analyze horse racing data from 2020 and identify the most important factors that contribute to winning races. By examining attributes like race distance, track conditions, and age group, the project will provide actionable insights for race optimization.

1.1.3 Objectives
Data Analysis: Perform thorough analysis of horse racing data from 2020.
Examine Performance Factors: Explore the impact of variables such as race distance, track type, and horse age.
Impact Assessment: Assess how different features affect the likelihood of a horse winning a race.
Recommendations: Provide recommendations to trainers, jockeys, and race organizers based on the analysis.
2. Importing Packages
Various Python libraries such as matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and seaborn are used for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. These libraries need to be imported before performing the analysis.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
3. Loading Data
The dataset (races_2020.csv) is loaded into the workspace using pandas for analysis.

python
Copy code
race_df = pd.read_csv("races_2020.csv")
print(race_df.head())
4. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is an essential part of the project, ensuring that the dataset is suitable for analysis. Steps include:

Removing irrelevant columns like hurdles.
Filling missing values in columns such as rclass, band, and currency.
Handling duplicates and renaming columns for clarity.
python
Copy code
# Remove the 'hurdles' column from the dataframe
race_df = race_df.drop(columns=['hurdles'])

# Fill missing values in 'rclass' and 'band' columns with 'Unknown'
race_df['rclass'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)
race_df['band'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)

# Fill missing values in 'currency' with the most common currency
most_common_currency = race_df['currency'].mode()[0]
race_df['currency'].fillna(most_common_currency, inplace=True)

# Check for duplicate rows and rename columns
duplicate_values = race_df.duplicated().sum()
new_column_names = [...]
race_df.columns = new_column_names
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project performs EDA to visualize key trends and patterns in the data. EDA is crucial for understanding the relationships between variables such as race distance, track conditions, and prize distribution.
